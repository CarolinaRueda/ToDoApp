# Prioritune

Hello !! Welcome to the this little project, it's a ToDo app styled with **Tailwindcss**

---

### Description

In this application you can store your to-dos.
I use typescript, tailwindcss and store the information in the localstorage.

### Setup

1. Run **`npm install`** in the root, so every dependency in the package.json file installs correctly.
2. In the root **`npm run dev`** to start both server and client for the app work properly.

## Dependencies

- tailwindcss/forms
- react
- react-dom
- react-icons
- uuid
